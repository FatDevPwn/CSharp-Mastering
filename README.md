By far, the best way to learn how to code is to write as much code as possible. Entering code yourself in each exercise and solving small coding challenges will speed your learning.

You might be tempted to select Copy or Run and skip all the keystrokes. However, we encourage you to enter this line of code yourself. Entering the code yourself builds muscle memory and helps you gain insights that you wouldn't get otherwise.

You are absolutely right my friend. I had studied very much old languages when I was doing my diploma in computer science e.g., GW Basic, Cobol, C, FoxPro. But one thing is very much sure that Computer programming is really a great fun and very much interesting subject. Once you start work on any project, you will never ever stop unless you get what you were planning to achieve.
