You are absolutely right my friend. I had studied very much old languages when I was doing my diploma in computer science e.g., GW Basic, Cobol, C, FoxPro. But one thing is very much sure that Computer programming is really a great fun and very much interesting subject. Once you start work on any project, you will never ever stop unless you get what you were planning to achieve.
